MP3::Find version 0.01
======================
DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to search for MP3 files by their ID3 tags. You
    can ask for the results to be sorted by one or more of those tags, and
    return either the list of filenames (the deault), a "printf"-style
    formatted string for each file using its ID3 tags, or the actual Perl
    data structure representing the results.

INSTALL

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install
